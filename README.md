## Data Day 2018 - Python Workshops

### Prerequisites
Working knowledge of Python and basic programming concepts. If you can write a for loop without too much effort, you'll be good to go.


For a quick brush-up on programming concepts, see [Data Carpentry's Short Introduction to Programming in Python](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/00-short-introduction-to-Python/)

You'll also want to be familiar with the basics of working with the command line. Mac users will use Terminal and Windows users can either use Command Line or download Git Bash at [https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash)

### Installation and Setup

Instructions for getting everything up and running on your computer can be found here: [Data Carpentry Python Setup](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/setup/)
